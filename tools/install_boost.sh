# This script will build and install Boost including Boost.Build.
# DOWNLOAD_PATH is expected to contain a boost archive in tar.bz2 format.
# Set the variables below to your needs. Assuming the defaults, this script
# will perform the following steps:
# - unpack boost_1_66_0.tar.* inside ~/Downloads
# - build Boost.Build and install it in:
#     ~/Software/boost_1_66_0
# - build Boost for the host and install it in:
#     ~/Software/boost_1_66_0
# - build Boost for the Xeon Phi and install it in:
#     ~/Software/boost_1_66_0_mic
# - create version independent symlinks
#     ~/Software/boost
#     ~/Software/boost_mic
# - append Boost specific exports to your .bashrc
# - create some build_boost*.log files in the current directory

# NOTES:
# If you want the Boost MPI library, you need to create user-config.jam in your
# home containing the line "using mpi ;".
